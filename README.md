# godot_topdown_mockup

A very basic mockup for a top-down auto-battler game.

## General Structure

Even without a complete play style, the idea is to have your units - coming from the left - advancing
through an infinite-scrolling map towards right, encountering more and more enemies as the progression goes.

In the game there are going to be two extra elements:
	- A periodical choice to be taken, regarding types of enemies and such (possibly consuming a limited resource like Activation Dice)
	- A real-time user-controlled weapon, like bombing runs.
(and maybe some direct WASD-controls for ONE unit, just for fun.)
